		<iiText>Roof Condition</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Check Your Answers (CYA) For 2.0 - Roof Condition:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Section 2 - Exterior Roof&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not get on any roof if it is wet or damp!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is best to inspect the roof on your hands and knees for safety and the ability for a closer examination of issues that otherwise might be missed.&amp;nbsp; Also, in addition to photos of specific roof items, don’t forget overview photos of the roof showing a front to back view and the back to front view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type of Roof Material – this information can be easily obtained from the manufacturer’s brochure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiberglass roof: A fiberglass roof is the hardest and most solid type of RV roof. They will not flex like a metal roof and feel much different than a rubber roof, being hard to the touch.&amp;nbsp; A fiberglass roof is very smooth and even dangerously slick when wet.&amp;nbsp; It may also have sand-like textured areas that are there to be used as walkways on the roof surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal roofs: looks like metal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubber roofs or EPDM roofs (ethylene propylene-diene manomer): EPDM roofs are the only type of rubber roof that is soft. If it looks and feels like rubber, it probably is.&amp;nbsp; As the rubber of an EPDM roof gets older, it may start to produce a white chalky texture, this is because the rubber is breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EPDM (could have a black bottom, white or other color on the top)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TPO roofs (thermoplastic polyolefin membrane):&amp;nbsp; They will vary from a EPDM rubber roof in that the material will have a slight textured pattern that might be described as a light pebble finish or fine stucco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinyl roofs:&amp;nbsp; They are slick, like an awning.&amp;nbsp; Unless specified by the RV manufacturer, this type of roofing system will probably be an aftermarket install that has been done by the owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following things when inspecting an RV roof:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Most manufacturers say a roof life is approximately 7 to 12 years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Check for holes, patches or missing pieces on the roof&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Look for and report on missing or cracking sealant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Anything that might have the appearance that it may have been removed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Missing and broken pieces from any of the protective coverings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Bubbles in the roof adhesives &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Look in each section for a detailed list of things to inspect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roof Overview - Check the overall condition of the roof and make the following conclusion as to its condition. (Acceptable, Fair, Poor)&amp;nbsp; Use the Walksheet Definitions document to determine the actual condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indication of Water Intrusion - Check that the roof is not spongy in any area or shows spotting or staining indicative of any water intrusion.&amp;nbsp; If any, make a note and then check the inside of the RV at the same point, as well as surrounding areas.&amp;nbsp; Water is an RV’s worst enemy!&amp;nbsp; The sealants perform a very important function, and we need to inspect them very closely for any cracking or deterioration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front Cap/Joints and Seals - Check seams and joints where the roof meets the front cap making sure that the sealant is not deteriorating, cracking, pulling away, or the screws are not pulling out and that the seam is not separating between the roof and front cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sealants used - Check the RV's owner's manual for this information or Google it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proper sealant inspection includes not just a visual observation, but running a finger along the sealant seams also verifies proper adhesion to the surface.&amp;nbsp; Sealants, in general, do not have “set” lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Butyl: is like a putty, but can come in a tube like caulk, also known as seam sealant, usually white/gray/black in color.&amp;nbsp; Butyl used when installing moldings, windows, doors, and vents, ladder supports and anything that is installed or requires a hole placed into the RV.&amp;nbsp; This type of sealant is recommended for use on RV rubber roofs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Silicone:&amp;nbsp; This sealant is extremely versatile.&amp;nbsp; It is flexible, durable, and is resistant to temperature extremes.&amp;nbsp; It is used along the seams of the roof, vent covers, around antennas, etc.&amp;nbsp; Silicone may be specified as the approved sealant to use on fiberglass roofs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Latex has some of the same properties as silicone, so this could make it a little harder to determine the difference between them.&amp;nbsp; One thing is to see how well they stick to the material. Latex is not recommended for application on a rubber roof as it is harder when cured and not as pliable as silicone.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mixed:&amp;nbsp; Would, of course, be a mixture of the above.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Other- anything else that may not match the above criteria, like sealant tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awning Rail Trim - Curbside:&amp;nbsp; Check the seams and joints where the curbside sidewall meets the roof making sure that the sealant is not deteriorating, cracking, or pulling away, or the screws are not pulling out, and the rail is coming off.&amp;nbsp; Also check the sealant condition where the rail trim has seams to be sure that area is properly sealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The awning rail trim rail could be a stand-alone rail which would be attached to the sidewall or combined with the curbside awning rail trim rail where the roof and the side wall meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rear Cap/Joints and Seals:&amp;nbsp; Check seams and joints where the roof meets the rear cap making sure that the sealant is not deteriorating, cracking or pulling away, the screws are not pulling out, or there is a separation between the roof and cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trim Rail/Streetside:&amp;nbsp; Check the seams and joint where the roof meets the streetside sidewall making sure that the sealant is not deteriorating, cracking, pulling away, or the screws are pulling out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roof Vents and Skylights &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vents - Hand crank 14 X 14:&amp;nbsp; Unless the vents are open or do not have an exterior vent cover on them, you will have to check the type from the inside.&amp;nbsp; Count the number of them from the top.&amp;nbsp; Check the condition of the cover for cracks or chips and check to see if the sealant as to its condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exterior vent covers - This is the cover that goes over the roof vents.&amp;nbsp; It may be bolted to the vent frame, or held with pins.&amp;nbsp; Remove the pins and cover to see the actual vent cover and sealant.&amp;nbsp; Count the number of vent covers on the roof, looking for cracks or missing pieces on the cover and attachment points.&amp;nbsp; Check to see if they all match and are the same color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plumbing vent covers:&amp;nbsp; Count the number of plumbing vent covers making sure that caps are in place, look for cracks or broken pieces and cracking or missing sealant, and if they all match and are the same color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roof refrigerator vent covers:&amp;nbsp; Look for cracks or broken pieces, as well as cracking or missing sealant.&amp;nbsp; Make a note of anything attached to the vent like solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skylights:&amp;nbsp; Count the number of skylights and look for cracks or broken pieces and cracking or missing sealant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AC #1, #2, #3, #4, #5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count how many there are and where they are located, naming them appropriately: Air conditioner #1 is located on the front of the RV.&amp;nbsp; Air conditioner #2 is located in the middle of the RV, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shroud:&amp;nbsp; Look to see if there are any broken places or cracks in the shroud, missing screws, or anything mounted to the shroud, like solar panels.&amp;nbsp; Do not remove the shroud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coils and Fins:&amp;nbsp; Look through the hole or slits on the side or the back to see the condition of the coils and fins.&amp;nbsp; Rate the condition of the fins to determine whether there is any minor or major damage to them.&amp;nbsp; This is a visual check only.&amp;nbsp; Do not remove the shroud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roof Accessories (Antennas, Ladder, Solar Panels)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV Antenna:&amp;nbsp; Determine whether it is a crank up or stationary antenna.&amp;nbsp; Check the sealant for deterioration and for any missing or broken pieces on the unit.&amp;nbsp; Check the condition of the RG-6 cable to be sure it in not nicked or cracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satellite Antenna:&amp;nbsp; Only the satellites that are mounted or installed on the RV will be subject to inspection. Check mounting locations for sealant that is deteriorating, as well as the cables.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to check the sealant around any cables that penetrate the roof to be sure sealant is between the cables and the roof surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio Antenna:&amp;nbsp; Check for broken or missing parts and deteriorating sealant.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar Panels:&amp;nbsp; Verify the number of panels, the sealant condition around all mounting locations, and loose or missing parts.&amp;nbsp; Remember that only the solar panels mounted to the RV are commented on.&amp;nbsp; NRVIA inspectors do not verify the operation of these units, just that they are present, their appearance, and if there is any damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladder - Roof Access&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladder:&amp;nbsp; Is it a fixed or removeable ladder?&amp;nbsp; Check to see if it is secured to the RV,&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp; hardware is not loose,&amp;nbsp; and check for deteriorating sealant.&amp;nbsp; Also check for bent ladder supports and steps, especially at the lower portions of the ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Ladder usage:&amp;nbsp; due to the importance of correct ladder etiquette during an RV inspection it is highly recommnded to not use the roof ladder installed on the RV.&amp;nbsp; Use your own ladder that has padding installed on it to protect the finish of the RV.&amp;nbsp; Do not lean a ladder against slideouts, top fascia, awning covers, or windshields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Horns:&amp;nbsp; Check for airhorns, the locations of each, deteriorating sealant around the mounting hardware, and whether they function.&amp;nbsp; Some have a cover over the front of them, some a wire mesh, or they may have no cover.&amp;nbsp; If no cover is present be sure and look inside for mud daubers, etc.&amp;nbsp; Air horns may also be located in the front access area in the front cap and not on the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipment that has been removed:&amp;nbsp; Look carefully to see if if any equipment may have been removed like satellite dishes, antennas, solar panels, etc.&amp;nbsp; Any unsealed screw holes are potential water intrusion areas and need to be mentioned within your report with recommendations for evaluation by a qualified RV technician for possible water damage or to avoid any future water ingress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other (List and Evaluate):&amp;nbsp; Anything not covered above like weather stations, ham radio antennas, etc.&amp;nbsp; Only evaluate these items if they are to remain with the RV after the sale.&amp;nbsp; Take pictures of their existence and note them on the inspection report.&lt;BR&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Leveling System Condition</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Leveling System Condition – is the system, in its entirety, performing its function of leveling the RV from front to back and streetside to curbside?
&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer of the leveling system will most likely be listed on the control panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveling System Type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air – Hydraulic – this is found on class A diesel vehicles with an air-ride system (airbags).&amp;nbsp; The air must be dumped before the RV can be leveled.&amp;nbsp; In newer RVs this is an automatic feature when auto level is engaged.&amp;nbsp; In older RVs the air dump is a manual action that must be done before the levelers are activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air and Hydraulic - the RV can be leveled with either the airbags or with the hydraulic jacks.&amp;nbsp; This type of system will be present on some higher end diesel pushers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric – the jacks are actuated by an electric motor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydraulic – they will look the same as the air-hydraulic system, except there is no air bag component to the suspension system.&amp;nbsp; This option is more common in class A gas engine RVs.&lt;/p&gt;

		<iiText>ASME Tank</iiText>
		<iiHelp>ASME Tank – is the tank performing its function of safely storing the liquid propane?
&lt;p&gt;LP Leak System Test – did the propane system hold 8” WC for five minutes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LP Detector – did the LP Detector work and is it current?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon Monoxide Detector – did the CO Detector work and is it current?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoke Detector – did the smoke detector work and is it current?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire Extinguisher – is the fire extinguisher the right size for the RV and is it in a charged state?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASME Tank Hoses and Regulators – are the hoses without cracks and the regulator in working order?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASME Tank Size – found on the plate welded to the tank and near the service valve.&amp;nbsp; It will show YR and then the four digit value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASME – Date of Manufacture – found on the plate welded to the tank and near the service valve.&amp;nbsp; The label might show GAL or WC for the tank gallon size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASME – Cover Over the Regulator – is the regulator covered&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASME – Regulator Vents Downward – does the vent point down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASME – Shutoff Valve Installed – is there a service shutoff valve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASME – Extend-a-Stay installed – is there an additional hose located between the regulator and the ASME tank that looks like it attaches to an external DOT cylinder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASME – Signs of Rust – if there is significant rust on the tank, be sure to comment that further evaluation be performed to determine the safety of the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LP System Leak Test – note the time the test began and the time completed (five minutes).&amp;nbsp; Take pictures of the cooktop working before beginning the test, one at the start of the test, one at the end of the test, and the last picture of the cooktop working once the stove is put back together (risk management).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PROPANE LEAK TEST PROCEDURES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: You will ONLY be able to perform the Leak Test (Timed Pressure Drop Test) and not properly set the Propane Regulator since there is a 2nd regulator installed in the cook stove manifold line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Turn OFF all appliances or devices that use Propane. This includes ALL pilot lights. There must not be any Propane gas flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; Turn OFF the Propane at the DOT cylinder of ASME tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Lift up the cover of the cook stove top exposing the burner assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; Remove one of the burner assemblies. Typically a screw will secure the assembly base to the stove top pan. By removing this screw the burner assembly can be pulled away from the burner manifold exposing a small stub out with a small orifice hole in it. This stub is called the “burner spud fitting”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; Attach the Manometer hose over the spud fitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; Turn ON the Propane at the DOT Cylinder or ASME Tank and fill the Propane system. Wait about 5 seconds and TURN OFF the Propane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.&amp;nbsp; Go to the burner assembly that the Manometer is hooked to and turn ON the burner knob allowing gas to flow into the burner spud and the Manometer.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You should be reading approximately 10 to 11 inches of Water Column on the manometer with the burner knob turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.&amp;nbsp; Turn ON one of the other burner knobs and “bleed down” the Propane gas pressure in the gas line to EXACTLY 8 inches of water column. Once the pressure has been bled down, then turn off the 2nd burner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9.&amp;nbsp; Let the manometer sit for 5 minutes at the 8 inches of water column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You are looking to see if the Propane in the system bleeds off through a leak which would indicate a problem with the integrity of the Propane system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the 8 inches of water column pressure drops during the 5 minute test…there is a LEAK!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: if there is a leak it MUST be repaired by a qualified RV technician for the safety of the RV occupants. Many states require that you have a license or certification to perform repairs on RV Propane Systems.&amp;nbsp; Please check with a dealer or service center to have safe repairs performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10.&amp;nbsp; Once the Propane system has been tested, the system must be restored to its original condition. Burner must be reinstalled over the burner spud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: For Safety Reasons – Only if there is NO LEAK found can the DOT Cylinder or ASME tank be turned on!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LP Detector – use a butane lighter to spray gas into the units sniffer.&amp;nbsp; Wait 30 – 60 seconds for the unit to alarm.&amp;nbsp; If the propane system has a solenoid to shutoff the system when in alarm, it will need to be reset in order for propane appliances to continue working.&amp;nbsp; Note the date of manufacture, the model and serial number on the back of the unit, once removed from its fixed location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon Monoxide Detector – push the button to test the unit.&amp;nbsp; Remove it from its location and look for the model and serial number, as well as the date of manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoke Detector – push the button to test the unit.&amp;nbsp; Remove it from its location and look for the model and serial number, as well as the date of manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire Extinguisher – verify that it is secure in its mounting bracket, it is located within 24” of the entry door, the gauge shows it is charged, and it is the right size for the RV: 10BC for a towable RV and 10BC for a motor home or towable RV with a generator or fuel system.&lt;BR&gt;</iiHelp>

&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator Cooling Sources – what sources does the refrigerator cool with?&amp;nbsp; Be careful with the 12-volt option.&amp;nbsp; This is only for fridges that can actually cool with just a 12-volt power source.&amp;nbsp; This does not mean 12-volts for the control board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Operates on all available sources – the inspector need to test that the refrigerator works on all sources.&amp;nbsp; For example, test on electric first.&amp;nbsp; It should be on when you get there, and if connected to shore power, and auto setting, the fridge should have chosen the electric option.&amp;nbsp; Once the fridge is cool using electric, turn off the electric option and turn it on using the gas option.&amp;nbsp; Now open the fridge door and verify on the outside of the RV, with the vent cover off, visually and audibly verify that the fridge burner assembly has ignited and is operating with propane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator Type – is it a residential fridge or a traditional RV absorption fridge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Control Panel Location – observe and not location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator Door Latch – does the door latching system keep the door locked for travel.&amp;nbsp; Be sure this is also true for residential refrigerators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Odors – does the inspector notice any unusual odors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Temperatures in the Fridge and Freezer – using a fridge and freezer thermometer that has been in the unit for at least one hour, record the temperatures in the fridge and freezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – in Operation for 12 Hours Before the Inspection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Does the Inside Light Work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Thermostat Sensor Control Mounted on Inside Fins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Thermistor – is it fixed to the inside fins or is it adjustable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Recall Kit Installed – verify that the refrigerator is not on recall.&amp;nbsp; This is most common in Norcold and Dometic units.&amp;nbsp; This can be verified at these websites: &lt;A href="https://norcold.com/recall-information/"&gt;https://norcold.com/recall-information/&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="https://www.dometic.com/en-us/us/lp/refrigerator-recall"&gt;https://www.dometic.com/en-us/us/lp/refrigerator-recall&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooktop – Brand, Model, and Serial Number – best source for this info is the label that is visible once the cooktop cover is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooktop – All Burners Light and Operate – light all burners, verify flame color, and take a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooktop – Rubber Grommets for Cooktop Grate – there are usually rubber grommets between the cooktop grates and the cooktop surface to prevent rattles during travel.&amp;nbsp; Verify their existence and comment if missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooktop – Burner Ignition Source – is there a piezo that creates a spark and lights the burner assemblies, is it a manual system that requires a butane lighter, is there standing pilot, perhaps the cooktop is an induction unit, or other ignition source?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oven - Brand, Model and Serial Number – May be the same as the cooktop if it is a one-piece unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oven – Burner Ignition Source – is there a piezo that creates a spark and lights the burner assemblies, is it a manual system that requires a butane lighter, is there standing pilot that needs to be lit first, or other ignition source?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microwave – Brand, Model and Serial Number – this information can be obtained from the label that may be is inside the microwave door and on the door frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microwave - Type – is it just a microwave or is it a microwave/convection combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microwave Output Wattage Rating – this information can be obtained from the label that may be is inside the microwave door and on the door frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micro/Convection Oven – Fan Blower Comes on – preheat the convection oven to check if the blower motor comes on and starts to heat.&amp;nbsp; For higher levels of inspection the inspector can use an oven thermometer to verify that the set temperature is achieved inside the oven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microwave – Temperature of Water after heating for 60 seconds – place a cup of water (8 ounces) in the microwave and heat for sixty seconds on high.&amp;nbsp; Measure the temperature with a prob thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooktop Exhaust Vent – Part of the Microwave – is the cooktop stove venting part of the microwave unit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooktop Exhaust Vent – Venting – how does it vent?&amp;nbsp; Does it recirculate or vent to the exterior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dishwasher – Brand, Model and Serial Number – obtain form the units manufacturer label, or from the build sheet, if present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dishwasher – Operational and Results of Operation – does the dishwasher operate and what were the results?&amp;nbsp; Run it on a short cycle to verify that it completes a cycle and that no leaks were present.&lt;BR&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Sidewall Condition</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Front Cap / Wall: the front of the RV where the front cap joins the curbside and streetside sidewalls and the roof.
&lt;p&gt;Curbside Sidewall: typically, the main entry door side of the RV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streetside Sidewall: typically referred to as the driver's side of the RV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rear Cap / Wall: the rear of the RV where the rear cap joins the sidewalls and the roof.&amp;nbsp; Is it molded or flat panel (laminated, metal, rivet or fiberglass)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the inspection, you will be looking to see if there are any of the following:&lt;BR&gt;• Cracks, holes, dents, or scratches&lt;BR&gt;• Signs of delamination (can occur if adhesives were applied improperly during assembly or the assembly process not done right, or where water has penetrated the walls and is making the exterior wall wavy)&lt;BR&gt;• Decals that do not belong to the unit&lt;BR&gt;• Decals that are peeling or fading&lt;BR&gt;• Screws that are loose or backing out &lt;BR&gt;• Paint that is fading, blistering, or peeling&lt;BR&gt;• Sealant that is failing - WATER INTRUSION areas&lt;BR&gt;• Broken or missing pieces (lights, door latches, rubber seals, windows)&lt;BR&gt;• Cracking in the windows, rubber trim deteriorating&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laminated Panel - is one piece from the frame to the roof, does not round up over onto the roof but meets to form a 90-degree angle and fasten together at that point. Laminated construction refers to a process by which, for example, the interior wall surface, framing, insulation and exterior wall join into a single unit by a construction-grade adhesive. The unit, be it a wall, floor or roof, is assembled layer by layer, with adhesive placed between each of the layers. A mechanical process is used to apply pressure to the entire unit until the adhesive dries and bonds, after which the unit moves along the assembly line. The pressure application may be via a pair of large pinch rollers through which the assembly passes through, a mechanical press or a vacuum process, which uses a large press that applies pressure as a vacuum is applied.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Metal - Ribbed or Flat, the ribbed ones have sections that overlap one another. An Airstream would be a good example of a flat look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminum comes in two forms: as a corrugated panel stock that is assembled in interlocking sections, and large, smooth aluminum panels usually found on higher-end models.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Molded Cap - is made of one piece and will be attached to the rooftop. Check to see if the caps are properly attached to the roof.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Rivet Metal Panel - same as either the metal or rib panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiberglass - is available in several styles, including corrugated and smooth. The corrugated type is most often used on affordably priced RVs while smooth fiberglass can often be found on all kinds of rigs in all price ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wall Surface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Full Body Paint - will feel smooth to the touch without that raised feeling like the decals have.&amp;nbsp; It will consist of multiple colors, typically in a swirl pattern and elaborate graphics.&amp;nbsp; There is a clearcaot finish over the painted graphics leaving a very shiny finish.&amp;nbsp; Another distinguishing factor will be that all sides will look similar and the graphics will flow seamlessly from side to side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full Body Paint with Decals - are usually applied to an RV after the paint was applied. When you rub your hand over the RV decal, you will feel it raise off the paint.&amp;nbsp; Some manufacturers will apply the brand designation to the sidewalls, and these are considered a decal.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Paint with Decals - the unit will be painted and then the decals applied. it is different than full body paint in that the paint will not be mixed colors forming a graphic pattern.&amp;nbsp; When you rub your hand over the decal, you will feel it raise off the paint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiberglass with Decals - a smooth wall surface that will not have the shine of paint, or full body paint.&amp;nbsp; Depending on the manufacturer, it may also have a slight texture, like a boat.&amp;nbsp; The fiberglass skin may be white, or a light color that is impregnated into the wall material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other - Metal like the Airstream trailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass with frame - a metal frame surrounds the glass panels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass with no frame - glass around all edges of the window as they meet the sidewall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargo doors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the inspection, you will be looking to see if there are any of the following;&lt;BR&gt;• Cracks, holes, dents, or scratches&lt;BR&gt;• Signs of delamination (can occur if the adhesives were improperly applied during the manufacturing process or the assembly process wasn't done right. or where water has penetrated the walls and is making the outer wall wavy)&lt;BR&gt;• Decals that do not belong to the unit&lt;BR&gt;• Decals that are peeling or fading&lt;BR&gt;• Screws that are loose or backing out &lt;BR&gt;• Paint that is fading or checking&lt;BR&gt;• Sealant that is failing (signs of water staining in the cargo area)&lt;BR&gt;• Broken or missing pieces (door latches, rubber seals,)&lt;BR&gt;• That all keys work &lt;BR&gt;• That the cargo doors open and close and are held open by the system used to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None - some of the motorhomes do not have one in the front cap. They may have the slide out generator compartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Locks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doors w/Keyed locks - a latch that is pushed and requires a key to lock and unlock&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Doors w/Slam latch - a larger door latch that requires the door to slam in order to engage the latch mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Door w/Keyed Slam latch - a larger door latch that requires the door to slam in order to engage the latch mechanism and is keyed to lock and unlock.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Doors w/Twist latch - a twisting type latch to sucure the door to the door frame&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doors w/Keyed Twist latch - a twisting type latch to sucure the door to the door frame and requires a key to lock and unlock &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misc Items on exterior walls&lt;BR&gt;For the inspection, you will be looking to see if there are any of the following;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look to see if there are any cracking, or pieces broken &lt;BR&gt;Checking the seals around the installed unit &lt;BR&gt;Range hood vent - check the tabs that hold it shut &lt;BR&gt;Refrigerator vents - locking tabs operate as intendedSpeakers - appropriate sealant &lt;BR&gt;Dryer vent - Check the flap of the dryer vent</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Tire / Rim Condition</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Tire Condition - evaluate the overall condition of the tire paying close attention to the sidewall for cracks, bubbles, and gouges.
&lt;p&gt;Normal Radial Sidewall - Indentations are quite natural on radial tires and will not affect performance. Tires feature one or more layers of fabric cord within its sidewall construction that run parallel to each other. (Steel cords are used within the tread.) Where the cords overlap, there is often slight indentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tire with a bulge or bubble cannot be repaired. Damage and Replacement Issues: a bulge or bubble on the sidewall of a tire generally indicates damaged cords caused by a severe impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damaged cords often are accompanied by a visible break in the inner liner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If cords have been damaged, air has infiltrated into the plies and can result in a bulge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution: recommend replacement of the tire and take the tire to a certified tire specialist or retail tire dealer for that brand to have a proper inspection performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulging, is not normal on a tire. It signifies that there is a gap between the cords, and must be replaced immediately. The recommendation is NOT to drive on this tire, even down the road to a tire retailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this easy math: indentations = good; bulges = bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damage That Requires Repair - Tire Damage Issues: most punctures nail holes, or cuts up to ¼" confined to the tread may be repaired by trained personnel using industry-approved procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tread Condition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wear on Both Edges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underinflation: reduces tread life through increased treadwear on the outside edges (or shoulders) of the tire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generates excessive heat, which reduces tire durability and can lead to tire failure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduces fuel economy through increased rolling resistance (soft tires make the vehicle work harder)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution: add air to the tire until it reaches the proper air pressure (psi, as measured by an air pressure gauge). To find the proper air pressure, consult the RV’s owner’s manual or find the recommended psi on the VIN Data Plate, the door jamb, or the load chart of the tire manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uneven Tread Wear can be caused by poor alignment.&amp;nbsp; The client after a test drive may comment that it pulled to the left or right.&amp;nbsp; This could verify your findings based on the tire tread wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scalloped Tear Wear - uneven front or rear tire wear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sawtooth or Feathered Edges – If a vehicle is misaligned, the edges of the tread have a sawtooth or feathered appearance.&amp;nbsp; This is caused by erratic scrubbing against the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution:&amp;nbsp; the RV most likely needs a toe-in or toe-out alignment correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wear in Center and Excessive Wear - On an overinflated tire, the center of the tread bears most of the load and wears out faster than the outside edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cupping (also called dipping or scalloping) is most common on front tires.&amp;nbsp; This May be a sign that wheels are out of balance or that suspension or steering system parts need service or replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bar Across Tread - most tires have treadwear indicator bars at 2/32" of remaining tread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the tread is worn down to 2/32" or when you can see the treadwear indicator bars on any section of the tire, the tire is worn out and should be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some larger tires have a triangle type graphic on the sidewall of the tire near the tread.&amp;nbsp; When the tread wears to the tip of the triangle, replacement is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOT Date - Tires made in the United States have the DOT serial number located on the inside sidewall near the rim. The letters “DOT” are followed by eight to thirteen letters and/or numbers that identify where the tire was manufactured, tire size and the manufacturer's code, along with the week and year the tire was manufactured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are DOT Codes on both sides of the tire.&amp;nbsp; The one we want is going to be on either the inside of the tire, or on the outside of the tire[HJ1]&amp;nbsp; sidewall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the last two digits of the DOT code. The last two digits are the year of manufacture. If the last two digits are 07, for example, the tire was manufactured in 2007. The two digits before the year indicate the week of the year that the tires were manufactured.&amp;nbsp; If your DOT code is a 3-digit number, it means your tire was produced before 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) and the NTSB say tires expire in six years. The British Rubber Manufacturers Association “strongly recommends” that all tires should be replaced 10 years from the date of manufacture and that unused tires should not be put into service if they are more than six years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load Capacity – indicated on the tire sidewall in both pounds and kilograms at maximum air pressure recommended by the tire manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load Range - The load range/ply rating branded on a tire's sidewall identifies how much load the tire is designed to carry at its industry specified pressure.&amp;nbsp; It might indicate, “load range E” or in the case of a Michelin tire state “LRG”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, for lighter duty tires&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load Range Ply Rating&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Maximum Load Pressure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 35 psi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 6&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 50 psi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 8&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 65 psi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 10&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 80 psi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 12&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 95 psi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RV Manufacturer's Recommended Inflation Air Pressure - the RV manufacturer's recommendation for the maximum cold air pressure of the tire.&amp;nbsp; This value is located on the Incomplete chassis VIN data plate or the manufacturer's VIN data plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Air Pressure – This will be taken with a tire gauge at the time of the inspection.&amp;nbsp; Values can very side to side based on whether the tires are sitting in the sun during warm days and could skew expected values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single Tire Rating / Dual Tire Rating - "Dual" is when there are two at the end of the axle.&amp;nbsp; Just like a dually (DRW) truck. The "Single" rating is how much weight that tire is rated to carry when in the "Single" configuration. The "Dual" rating is how much weight that one tire is rated to carry in the "Dual" configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spare Tire Rack – The spare tire rack may be attached to the rear of the RV or it may be underneath the RV.&amp;nbsp; Inspectors do not drop the spare tire to check needed information in this section.&amp;nbsp; Record what you can see and state NA if what you need to report is not visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spare Tire Jack and Tools – look for the jack and tools for the spare tire and state if they are not present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tag Axle Tire - A tag axle RV is a motorhome with a third axle located behind the rear drive axle. This axle typically has a one wheel assembly on each side and is a non-drive axle. Its main purpose is to increase carrying capacity and shock resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tire Valve Extensions - Comment if you notice that metal or braided stainless hoses have been added to the tire valves to make airing up the tires easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tire Pressure Monitors - Whether internal or external to the tire, comment on their presence.&amp;nbsp; If installed externally, do not remove them to get the tire pressure.&amp;nbsp; Ask the owner for the readout device and get the tire pressure reading from there and comment that you did so.&lt;BR&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Frame and Latching Mechanism</iiText>
		<iiHelp>For the inspection, you will be looking to see if there are any of the following;&lt;BR&gt;• Condition of the fabric, checking for rips, tears, holes, and fraying ends or dirt&lt;BR&gt;• Condition of the awning mechanization, checking to see if all the pieces are present and that they all are in working order &lt;BR&gt;• Checking that they operate probably in their designed modes - electric or manual&lt;BR&gt;• Checking the condition of the sealant around sidewall penetrations
&lt;p&gt;Type of Awning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric - has a 12V power button to open and close, some may have a wind sensor that will close them at a certain wind speed.&amp;nbsp; Some have awning lights, check to see if the 12V buttons are working and the awning extends and retracts smoothly.&amp;nbsp; Video of the deployment and retraction is recommended.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Manual w/Strap - uses a metal bar with a hook to set the direction the awning goes, and then used to hook the strap. The strap helps the awning to start to extend and then it helps to retract the awning back to the stowed position.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manual - uses a metal hand crank system to open and close the awning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Door Awning &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric - has a 12V power button to open and close, check that they operate in and out smoothly. No rips or tears, no fraying or holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Window Awnings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric - has a 12V power button to open and close&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manual w/Strap - uses a metal bar with a hook to grab the strap, and then the strap is used to hook to the sidewall attachment point. The strap helps the awning to start to extend and then it helps to retract the awning back to the stowed position.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awning Fabric Type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloth -&amp;nbsp; looks and feels like cloth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinyl -&amp;nbsp; is slick like plastic, may have a shine to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other -&amp;nbsp; screen mesh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N/A -&amp;nbsp; if there is no awning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awning metal cover&amp;nbsp; - protects the awning when it is rolled up. Stays attached to the RV when the awning is rolled out.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Frame and mechanistic condition, -&amp;nbsp; there are manual and electric mechanisms but what they all have in common is that they all attach to the side of the RV. Check to make sure that all screws or bolts are tight to the frame and no gaps are visible.&amp;nbsp; Be sure the pistons, if included, deploy the awning smoothly and don't hang up allowing the fabric to unroll with ne frame mechanism movement.&amp;nbsp; Also be sure that the attchment screws to the sidewall have sealant around them.&lt;BR&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Operation and Condition of Outside Shower</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Fresh Water Systems–Vocabulary
&lt;p&gt;City Water Source – Unit will need to be hooked up with a hose to the city, campground or domestic water source. Pressure of the water flow comes from the flow thru the hose water source and can vary greatly. It could be pressure above the 40 psi suggested max for the water system and do damage or it could be so low that it causes issues with running items like on demand water heaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food Grade Water Hose – Water hose made of food grade material, usually white in color but brands are coming out in other colors such as blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure Regulator – Device that reduces the amount of pressure from the water source down to 40 psi. The simplest devices are the barrel type regulators that attach to the end of the hose usually closest to the water source. More elaborate devices have gauges showing the water pressure. The reason to have the regulator closer to the water source is to protest the hose. The reason to have it closer or inside the unit is so that they are not stolen.&amp;nbsp; Sample regulators shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-Board Water System – This system includes the fresh water holding tank, water pump, fixtures for filling the tank and any drainage lines for emptying the freshwater tank and overflow lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-Board System Water Pump – Device that pressurizes the water in the lines to push the water thru the lines to the water locations. The pumps turn on when the water source is open and turns off when the water source is closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresh Water Systems – Testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water Location Testing – Testing faucet knobs/handles to control flow of water and stopping of water flow with no leakage out of faucet or at base of knob/handle connections. Test for both hot and cold water where the connection allows for both. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City Water Pressure Testing - Is the pressure of the flow of water consistent at all faucets? Is it expected based on the water pressure at the City Water Source?&amp;nbsp; Does the water pressure stay consistent during the testing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City Water Connection Operational – Does the food grade water hose connect securely to the water source connection on the unit? Are there any cracks around the connection? Is there water leaking at the connection after the hose is hooked up and turned on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-Board Fresh Water System Water Fill Testing – Check with owner/dealer if they know the level of water in the freshwater tank. Check freshwater monitor panel level before filling. Connect food grade water hose to the fresh water fill on unit and fill with several gallons of water if applicable for testing. Unit should have ¼ level tank for testing the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-Board Fresh Water System Works - Be sure to find and turn on water pump. Test several of the water locations again, noting that the water pump turns on when the faucets are opened and turns off shortly after the water is turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-Board Fresh Water System Pump Testing - Pump should run only when faucets are being used. After testing several locations, leave the fresh water system pump on and listen for the pump to turn on and off for short bursts when the water is not being used. This usually indicates a leak somewhere in the fresh water system. Pressure at all water sources tested should be consistent for both hot and cold water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black and Gray Tanks - verify that they are performing their intended function of keeping the liquid waste in them.&amp;nbsp; There should be no leaks in the tanks that would be visible from dripping or puddling underneath the RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitor Panel - verify the readings on the panel at the time of the inspection.&amp;nbsp; Check with tanks by having some liquid in them and then empty to see if they reflect the change on the monitor panel.&amp;nbsp; Record the results.&amp;nbsp; Also verify that the battery level coincides with what you saw earlier in the battery and converter test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drain Cap in Place – put the sewer cap on the sewer outlet pipe and release a little gray water to see if the sewer cap holds back the liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve Leaks – open the black and gray valves, one at a time, and verify once closed that the gate valves stop the flow of liquid.&amp;nbsp; Also evaluate ease of operation and the valve type based on what you can see.&lt;BR&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Coolant Reservoir Condition</iiText>
		<iiHelp>How often should the coolant liquid be changed?
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically it should be good for an indefinite period. This is in theory, however in real world conditions, regardless of it’s quality, coolant (antifreeze) should be changed once every 2-5 years (average time after which it loses much of its benefits, unless specifically formulated as ‘lifetime’ on the bottle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inorganic Acid Technology (IAT) Bright Green coolant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commonly used in the cars produced in USA between 1920 and 1990.&lt;BR&gt;This contains silicates and phosphate corrosion inhibitors to protect metal parts such as the radiator and engine.&lt;BR&gt;Usually found in a bright green color, it is recommended to be flushed out of the cooling system every 30,000 miles or every 2 years. It’s typically used in older cars manufactured before the mid 1990s ( Domestic vehicles from ’20s to ’90s, GM, Ford, Chrysler)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic Acid Technology (OAT) Red coolant, Green Coolant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Present in newer cars all over the world, OAT coolant color ranges from pink, orange, bright red, red, blue and dark green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange coolantHybrid Organic Acid Technology (HOAT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mix between IAT and OAT coolants, it is designed for new cars. This contains added silicates that increase aluminium protection and prevents corrosion. Additives are also present to prevent rusting. To differentiate these a little easier, HOAT coolants are found in yellow, turquoise, pink, blue or purple colors.&lt;BR&gt;It is recommended to be flushed out of the system every 150,000 miles or 5 years. (Typically used in Major European, German and Asian car manufacturers, some Chrysler vehicles)</iiHelp>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;VIN: Stands for Vehicle Identification Number and is also referred to as the Chassis Number.&amp;nbsp; The VIN number is 17 characters and is a unique identifier found on all RVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When doing your inspection, you will need to have photos of all the data pieces in this section that apply. A clear photo of the VIN number must be included in your report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location of VIN: Identify where the VIN information is located on the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Class A motorhomes the most common locations to find the VIN information is in the dash/windshield (similar to an auto), next to the driver’s seat on the wall or inside a cabinet in the unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Class B &amp;amp; C motorhomes the most common locations to find the VIN information is in the dash/windshield (similar to an auto), next to the driver’s seat inside the door frame or inside a cabinet in the unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older models of motorhomes have the VIN information stamped into metal data plates as seen in some of the examples below and may be found in uncommon locations on the vehicle such as wheel wells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brand: The make or trade name of the RV. This is usually found in the decals and lettering on the unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model #: Identify the model number of the vehicle. The data labels should have a model number indicated on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturer Name and Location:&amp;nbsp; Identify who manufactured the unit and where was it manufactured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacture Date: Identify the date the unit was manufactured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frame Manufacturer Name: Identify who manufactured the frame on the unit. This is usually found on the incomplete data sticker. This applies to motorhomes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frame Number:&amp;nbsp; The frame number can sometimes be found on separate labels somewhere on the physical frame itself. Sometimes is it found on the data labels or the incomplete data sheet.&amp;nbsp; If there is no separate frame number found use the VIN number in this field. This applies to motorhomes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frame Manufacture Date: This is the date of when the frame was manufactured. This is usually found on the incomplete data sticker. This is also referred to as “Date of Incomplete Vehicle Manufacture”. This applies to motorhomes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR): This is found on the data stickers on the units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RVIA/Canadian Seal #: A letter and /or number indicating that the manufacturer manufactured the unit under compliance with the standards for Electrical, Plumbing, Heating and Fire Safety Codes set forth by RVIA (for US units) or CRVA (for Canadian units). Some units have this sticker posted near the entrance doors. If the sticker is not found, look for the RVIA Number on the build sheet of the unit or other paperwork if provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Inspection Sticker Current:&amp;nbsp; Some states require DOT inspections of motorhomes and if the unit passes the inspection, a sticker will be displayed in the wind shield. If the unit has a State Inspection Sticker, is it current as of the date of the inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State of Inspection Sticker: If the unit has a State Inspection Sticker, what is the state listed on the sticker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State &amp;amp; License Plate: If the unit has a license plate on it, what is the state it is from and what is the license plate number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Plate Current: If the unit has a license plate, is it current as of the date of inspection. &lt;/p&gt;

		<iiText>Hot Skin Test - Was any Frame and Running Gear Voltage Recorded</iiText>
		<iiHelp>HOT SKIN TEST:&amp;nbsp; When the 120v electrical voltage of the RV can no longer travel safely through the intended neutral and grounding wires, it is possible for that voltage to seek an alternate path through the frame of the RV.&amp;nbsp; These issues can also come from the electrical pedestal the RV is plugged into (verify before starting the test).&amp;nbsp; The RV Hot skin test allows the inspector to check for any unsafe voltages of five volts or more.
&lt;p&gt;“Frame/Running Gear” – parts of the RV frame that are accessible and that could be contacted by human hands, as well as the axle parts that are metal and attached to the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ext Wall Surface” – Any metal parts that are located on the exterior wall surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Handles/Frames” – metal handles that are part of doors, cargo doors, metal frames around cargo doors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Frames/Trim” – window frames, especially at the weep holes where the VOM probe can be inserted to check the window frames for voltage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Other” – any other areas that could be touched by human hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Power Source” – Does the RV require 30 amp or 50 amp service?&amp;nbsp; A three prong power plug end indicates 30 amp service and a four prong power plug would be for 50 amp service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Power Cord General Con” - Does the power cord have cuts or gashes in it, does it appear to be burnt or melted, does the plug end have prongs that are scorched or melted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sign of Repair to Power Cord/Connection" – If it looks like the plug end has been replaced by an aftermarket plug end or some other modifications have been made to the power cord, indicate that on the inspection report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Visual Inspection WITHOUT Power!” – Be sure the power cord is unplugged from its power source.&amp;nbsp; Cover the power cord plug end with a bag or a locking device and have a notification not to plug it into the 120v electrical service! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Circuit Panel Box Gen Con” – what is the condition of the cover, the panel door, the inside of the box, the bus bars, the grounding and neutral bars?&amp;nbsp; Does anything appear to have been exposed to electrical stress indicated by an electrical smell, scorching, or black residue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Circuit Breakers in Place” – Are the circuit breakers securely in place?&amp;nbsp; Observe if anything appears to be out of place, missing, or loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wiring Secure” – Are all black, white, and grounding wires securely fastened to their termination points?&amp;nbsp; Touch the wires to see if anything might pull out of its termination point, or be loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Signs of Repair or Service” – Have any modifications been made that would affect proper operation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wiring w/Signs of Discoloration from Heat” – Are any white neutral wires discolored: the white wire casing has turned brown?&amp;nbsp; Does any of the wires in the box appear to have melted wire insulation? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All White, Black &amp;amp; Ground Wires Kept Separated” – Black wires, White wires, and Green or Solid copper wires should all be kept separate as they are routed around the inside of the electrical box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Test Live w/Power Connected &amp;amp; Circuit Breakers On” – test all receptacles with a three prong polarity tester with the GFCI tester button.&amp;nbsp; We are looking for an open ground, open neutral wire, open hot wire, hot wire, and ground wire reversal, and a hot wire and neutral wire reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All Exterior Receptacles” – receptacles located on the exterior walls, inside entertainment centers located on exterior sidewalls, and around outside kitchen areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Receptacles in Bedroom” – receptacles located in the bedroom, or bedrooms of the RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Receptacles in Kitchen” – receptacles located in the kitchen area of the RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Receptacles in Dining Area” – receptacles that may be located in the dining area of the RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind all Electronics/App” – receptacles behind electronics and appliances.&amp;nbsp; Access to these may not be possible due to those items being secured in place.&amp;nbsp; If this is the case, comment as such and do not check this box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Receptacles in Storage Bay Areas” – receptacles in the outside storage bays that can be accessed by the inspector.&amp;nbsp; If items are being stored at the time of inspection and access is denied, comment as such on the inspection report and do not check this box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Receptacles Behind Refrigerator” – from the outside sidewall access panel to the back side of the absorption type refrigerator, verify the receptacles.&amp;nbsp; If the refrigerator has an icemaker, there may be two present in this area.&amp;nbsp; If there is a residential fridge installed, you may not have access to that receptacle.&amp;nbsp; Some manufacturers do provide an access panel; some do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Receptacles in Living Room” – receptacles located in the living room area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Receptacles in Bath and Toilet Area” – receptacles located in the bathroom and toilet areas of the RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GFCI Circuit Test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Location GFCI Protection Device(s) – test” – The purpose of a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) is a device that shuts off an electric power circuit when it detects that current is flowing along an unintended path, such as through water or a person.&amp;nbsp; The test for these devices is to use the three-prong polarity tester with the GFCI trip button to trip the GFCI device to be sure it is working.&amp;nbsp; If any of these fail the test, this is considered a life safety issue and should be tagged in the report as such.&amp;nbsp; You may find only one of these in an RV, or you may find several.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes the process of testing a regular receptacle by pushing the GFCI trip button on the tester will help to locate the protecting GFCI receptacle.&amp;nbsp; The click and loss of power will indicate it is protected by a GFCI receptacle, and the click may help you to know where the GFCI is located.&amp;nbsp; Once the GFCI is tripped, reset the GFCI by pushing the reset button and continue the test till all protected receptacles are verified.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Circuit Breaker Panel Box” – there are GFCI breakers that may feed multiple receptacles inside and outside the RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bathroom” – you may find a GFCI receptacle in the bathroom area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kitchen” – the kitchen may have a GFCI receptacle or the receptacles in the kitchen may be protected by another GFCI receptacle located elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GFCI Tripped, locate and test each affected receptacle with a polarity tester:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bathroom Receptacles” – locations are the same as indicated above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kitchen Receptacles” - locations are the same as indicated above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Storage Bays” - locations are the same as indicated above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Exterior Receptacles” - locations are the same as indicated above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Behind All Electronics &amp;amp; Appliances” - locations are the same as indicated above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Power Converter Test”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Voltage w/120 Volt AC Power ON” – with the RV plugged into shore power and having been so for at least an hour, verify the voltage of the 12v house batteries.&amp;nbsp; You can do this at either the batteries or the 12v fuse panel inside the RV if you have access to a positive and ground contact point or at the batteries themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Voltage w/120 Volt AC Power OFF” – turn the show power off and wait ten minutes or more for the 12v house system to settle.&amp;nbsp; Be sure not to have a significant load placed on the system: lots of lights on, fans on, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Did DC Voltage Drop, at Least, ½ a Volt" – if the voltage drops a half a volt this is an indication that the power converter is charging the house batteries.&amp;nbsp; If the uncharged voltage is recorded at less than 12.6v, then there may be an indication that the house batteries are weak.&amp;nbsp; For example, let's say you record 12.9v with the power converter on and 12.1v with the power converter off (no load applied).&amp;nbsp; The voltage drop was more than a half a volt.&amp;nbsp; So, this would indicate the converter is working but that the batteries may be weak.&amp;nbsp; This should be commented on in the comments sections and recommended that the batteries be evaluated by a qualified RV technician. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Converter Verified” – rate its performance based on this test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Generator System” If installed, note the brand, model, and serial number.&amp;nbsp; Do not RUN the generator while plugged into SHORE POWER!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspector is asked to evaluate the transfer switch.&amp;nbsp; This is accomplished by removing the shore power cord from the electrical supply and turning on the generator.&amp;nbsp; If power passes through to the RVs electrical system and 120 volts is available inside the RV, the transfer switch performed its function.&amp;nbsp; When the generator is turned off and shore power is returned to the RV, if 120 volts is once again available inside the RV, the transfer switch performed its function and it can be evaluated as acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Start and Running Performance” – rate the performance in the process of starting the generator and how it performed under load.&amp;nbsp; Make a comment if with a load placed on the generator it had issues running smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gen Condition of Generator” – what is its overall appearance: based your rating on the overall cleanliness of the generator, does it look like it has been maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Inspect Oil Level” – check oil level by removing the dipstick and verifying there is sufficient oil in the reservoir before starting the generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hours of Operation” – verify this value by checking either the meter reading on the generator or at the panel located inside the RV.&amp;nbsp; It could be upfront on the dashboard or in a services panel elsewhere in the RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“Are Circuit Breakers Set to ON?” – The circuit breaker on the generator should be in the "on" position for testing.&amp;nbsp; If power is not transferred inside during the test, reset the breaker by switching off then back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fuel Tank level above ¼ Tank” – generators will not operate if the fuel tank for the RV’s engine is low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Power Hooked Up to Gen” – Some generators will tie into the 120v system by a transfer switch.&amp;nbsp; When the generator is turned on the system will feed 120v power into the RV by use of a transfer switch.&amp;nbsp; Some RV’s do not have a transfers switch but will have a 30 amp or 50 amp receptacle box to allow the shore power cord to be plugged into.&amp;nbsp; Once the generator is started, and the shore power cord is plugged into this box, 120v from the generator will pass to the electrical panel inside the RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AC Voltage Reading” – with a VOM or digital monitor, read the voltage the generator is producing.&amp;nbsp; This is to be recorded with the system under fifty percent load.&amp;nbsp; For example, if the generator is a 5.5kw unit, at least, 2.75kw need to be placed on the generator.&amp;nbsp; In this case, an A/C unit and the water heater would be more than enough to test this generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Freq of Voltage HZ” – with either a VOM or a digital monitor, record the frequency, in hertz, the generator is producing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Location of Radiator if Installed” – if installed, where is it located?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Condition of radiator, reservoir, hoses” – a visual evaluation of the radiator, the reservoirs, and condition of the hoses to determine if they are performing their intended function, if they are visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oil Analysis Performed” – Yes or No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Coolant Analysis Performed” – Yes or No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Inverter System 12 V DC to 120 AC” - If installed, note the brand, model, and serial number.&amp;nbsp; Test when the RV is unplugged from shore power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Condition of Inverter” – a visual inspection of the inverter and how it appears, if visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Inspected Cables, Wiring &amp;amp; Fuses” – a visual inspection of the cables, wiring, and fuses, if visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Verified Operation with Load” – a test of the inverter with the shore power off to verify the house batteries and the inverter can produce AC voltage, and how it operates under approximately fifty percent load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“AC Voltage at Output” – this is the voltage produced by the inverter when turned on and under load.&amp;nbsp; If the inverter is a 2000-watt inverter, then approximately 1000 watts needs to be applied to the inverter to test its operation for five minutes.&amp;nbsp; If the voltage drops, check the 12v house battery input voltage.&amp;nbsp; If that has dropped significantly during the test, this may indicate weak batteries.&amp;nbsp; Frequency can also be verified – the same as with the generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“12 Volt DC Electrical System – Chassis Battery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gen Condition – Battery” – a visual inspection of the chassis batteries.&amp;nbsp; Depending on the class of RV, they may be located in several possible spots: in the rear of the RV for a diesel pusher, up front for a gas powered RV, in a storage bin, or under the entry steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Condition Battery Box” – a visual inspection of the box or area where the batteries are housed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Condition of Battery Cables &amp;amp; Terminals” – A visual inspection of the cables and terminals.&amp;nbsp; Are they corroded and in need of care or are they satisfactory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“12 Volt DC Electrical System – Coach Power."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Location of Deep Cycle Battery Stack” – locate the batteries by a comment such as curbside rear storage compartment, under the entry step, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Condition Battery Box” - a visual inspection of the box or area where the batteries are housed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Batteries Matched for Size &amp;amp; Age” – are the batteries of the same type and manufacturer and appear to be about the same age?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indication of Service” – do they appear to have been maintained?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Condition of Battery Cables &amp;amp; Terminals” - A visual inspection of the cables and terminals.&amp;nbsp; Are they corroded and in need of care or are they satisfactory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Batteries Operational” – from an earlier investigation, are they producing adequate DC voltage? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are NEG &amp;amp; POS Cable Size Matched &amp;amp; Marked” – a visual verification of the sizing of the battery cables to be sure they are of the same size and identified by color as to whether they are positive or negative cabling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If possible, check the water level in the batteries to be sure they are at an acceptable level.&amp;nbsp; There should be enough water to bring the level to the bottom of the vent, about 3/4" below the top of the cell.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuse Panel Box&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Condition Fuse Panel Area” – a visual verification of the condition of the fuse panel.&amp;nbsp; Are there any indications of stress to this part of the 12v system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Condition of Fuses” – visual verification of the condition of the fuses and a test of the continuity of each fuse.&amp;nbsp; These can be tested with a continuity tester or a 12v tester light.&amp;nbsp; The tester light is great for showing each fuse operation and for getting a photo for your risk management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Condition – Fuse Connection” – a visual verification of fuse connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wires, Terminals Tight” – Verify that all wires are terminated with a tight connection.</iiHelp>

&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Front Side Door Panels – what is the condition of the front door panels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Front Side Door Seals – do the door seals keep the cold air in?&amp;nbsp; The dollar bill test is always a good way to be sure.&amp;nbsp; Close the refrigerator door on a $1 bill or small piece of paper, trapping it between the gasket and fridge. Slowly pull the paper out. You should feel some tension as you do so; if not, the gasket may be weak or broken at this point. Repeat this test around the whole of the gasket's length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dishwasher – Hoses and Connections Condition – if visible, evaluate the water and waste connections to the unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STYLES AND MATERIALS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – note brand, model and serial number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator Cooling Sources – what sources does the refrigerator cool with?&amp;nbsp; Be careful with the 12-volt option.&amp;nbsp; This is only for fridges that can actually cool with just a 12-volt power source.&amp;nbsp; This does not mean 12-volts for the control board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Operates on all available sources – the inspector need to test that the refrigerator works on all sources.&amp;nbsp; For example, test on electric first.&amp;nbsp; It should be on when you get there, and if connected to shore power, and auto setting, the fridge should have chosen the electric option.&amp;nbsp; Once the fridge is cool using electric, turn off the electric option and turn it on using the gas option.&amp;nbsp; Now open the fridge door and verify on the outside of the RV, with the vent cover off, visually and audibly verify that the fridge burner assembly has ignited and is operating with propane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator Type – is it a residential fridge or a traditional RV absorption fridge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Control Panel Location – observe and not location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator Door Latch – does the door latching system keep the door locked for travel.&amp;nbsp; Be sure this is also true for residential refrigerators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Odors – does the inspector notice any unusual odors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Temperatures in the Fridge and Freezer – using a fridge and freezer thermometer that has been in the unit for at least one hour, record the temperatures in the fridge and freezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – in Operation for 12 Hours Before the Inspection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Does the Inside Light Work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Thermostat Sensor Control Mounted on Inside Fins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Thermistor – is it fixed to the inside fins or is it adjustable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerator – Recall Kit Installed – verify that the refrigerator is not on recall.&amp;nbsp; This is most common in Norcold and Dometic units.&amp;nbsp; This can be verified at these websites: &lt;A href="https://norcold.com/recall-information/"&gt;https://norcold.com/recall-information/&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="https://www.dometic.com/en-us/us/lp/refrigerator-recall"&gt;https://www.dometic.com/en-us/us/lp/refrigerator-recall&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooktop – Brand, Model, and Serial Number – best source for this info is the label that is visible once the cooktop cover is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooktop – All Burners Light and Operate – light all burners, verify flame color, and take a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooktop – Rubber Grommets for Cooktop Grate – there are usually rubber grommets between the cooktop grates and the cooktop surface to prevent rattles during travel.&amp;nbsp; Verify their existence and comment if missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooktop – Burner Ignition Source – is there a piezo that creates a spark and lights the burner assemblies, is it a manual system that requires a butane lighter, is there standing pilot, perhaps the cooktop is an induction unit, or other ignition source?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oven - Brand, Model and Serial Number – May be the same as the cooktop if it is a one-piece unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oven – Burner Ignition Source – is there a piezo that creates a spark and lights the burner assemblies, is it a manual system that requires a butane lighter, is there standing pilot that needs to be lit first, or other ignition source?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microwave – Brand, Model and Serial Number – this information can be obtained from the label that may be is inside the microwave door and on the door frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microwave - Type – is it just a microwave or is it a microwave/convection combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microwave Output Wattage Rating – this information can be obtained from the label that may be is inside the microwave door and on the door frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micro/Convection Oven – Fan Blower Comes on – preheat the convection oven to check if the blower motor comes on and starts to heat.&amp;nbsp; For higher levels of inspection the inspector can use an oven thermometer to verify that the set temperature is achieved inside the oven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microwave – Temperature of Water after heating for 60 seconds – place a cup of water (8 ounces) in the microwave and heat for sixty seconds on high.&amp;nbsp; Measure the temperature with a prob thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooktop Exhaust Vent – Part of the Microwave – is the cooktop stove venting part of the microwave unit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooktop Exhaust Vent – Venting – how does it vent?&amp;nbsp; Does it recirculate or vent to the exterior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dishwasher – Brand, Model and Serial Number – obtain form the units manufacturer label, or from the build sheet, if present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dishwasher – Operational and Results of Operation – does the dishwasher operate and what were the results?&amp;nbsp; Run it on a short cycle to verify that it completes a cycle and that no leaks were present.&lt;BR&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Air Conditioner - Condition</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Air Conditioner Condition – from what you can see from the inside, what is the condition of the air conditioner components.
&lt;p&gt;Air Conditioner – Filter Condition – are the filters clean, dirty, torn, or missing?&amp;nbsp; In most cases you do not need to remove the filter assembly to see them.&amp;nbsp; By shining a flashlight into the filter assembly the inspector can verify is they are dusty/dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Conditioner – Brand, Model and Serial Number – obtain from the air conditioner itself (the inspector may see a label through the AC shroud when evaluating the unit on the roof) or from the owner’s packet or build sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Conditioner – Thermostatic Controls – is the thermostat that controls the AC unit a stand-alone unit or does it also run the furnace, or does the thermostat also run multiple AC units.&amp;nbsp; It could be dual with the furnace and also zoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Conditioner – Options – is the AC unit only for cooling or does it also function as a heat pump or have an electric heat strip.&amp;nbsp; The best way to tell if these units’ function with dual functions is to check the option on the thermostat.&amp;nbsp; If the thermostat has electric heat and gas heat, chances are the unit has a heat pump.&amp;nbsp; The manufacturer brochure may also help here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Conditioner – Delta-T – Record the results of the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESTING THE EFFICIENCY OF AN AIR CONDITIONER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Turn on the air conditioner. Allow it to operate for at least 15 to 20 minutes so it can start to cool the coach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Insert a pocket thermometer into the return air grill of the unit –typically where the air filter is.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Let it read for about 5 minutes. Note this temperature reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Next, insert the thermometer in the air register that is closest to the air conditioner. Let it read for 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Compare the Return Air Temperature with the Discharge Air Temperature – this temperature difference is the efficiency of the unit of the Delta T of the air conditioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the unit is operating properly you should see an approximate difference of temperature of 14 to 22 degrees F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If you are in a desert area the temperature will be higher as the unit only has to cool the air, not strip moisture from the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If you are in an area that has high humidity you will see a lower Delta T or temperature difference due to the unit stripping the moisture from the air. You will have a larger amount condensation dripping off the coach.&lt;BR&gt;</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Door Condition</iiText>
		<iiHelp>For the inspection, you will be looking at the following;&lt;BR&gt;• The door lock mechanism to include the deadbolt and all keys&lt;BR&gt;• Hinges&lt;BR&gt;• Seals&lt;BR&gt;• Screen door and attachemnt to entry door.&amp;nbsp; With the screen door closed and the door open, when closing the door the screen door should re-attach itself to the door.&amp;nbsp; Check to be sure the screen door mechanism holds it to the door and also to the door frame.&lt;BR&gt;• Paint for cracks or deals fading or peeling&lt;BR&gt;• Glass window, if there is one, seals, installation screws and sealant 
&lt;p&gt;Type of door may be the same material as the unit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiberglass sheet - the same material as the sidewall the door is attached to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molded fiberglass - a curved door made of fiberglass to match the curvature of the sidewall the door is attached to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal - Motor homes are more likely to have a metal door on class A buses.&amp;nbsp; A good way to tell if you have a metal door is to use a magnet.&amp;nbsp; It will also have a different sound when knocked on compared to the sidewall the door is attached to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Door Locks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the keys or electric door lock key fob to test the door lock and deadbolt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step System &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the door steps are electric, they will open or close when the entry door opens and closes, or there may be a separate swith to activate them, otherwise they are a manual step system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Class C and Class B RVs have no exterior steps.&amp;nbsp; The manufacturer may refer to them as a zero entry step system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab Bar &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grab handle is a low profile handle attached to the sidewall by the entry door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A D Ring handle is much larger, has a letter "D" profile, and also swings in to rest flush with the RV sidewall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Cover &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some class A buses have a step cover that goes over the entry step so that during travel there is a flat floor surface by the passenger front seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Doors in a motorized unit? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are cases where you will use all three of these items.&amp;nbsp; In a class C, the Door #1 could become the driver door, Door #2 could become the front passenger door, and Other Door could become the Main Entry Door on the sidewall of the RV.</iiHelp>

		<iiText>Engine Running Conditions</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Engine Running Condition – while the engine is running to warm up for fluid analysis, perhaps to operate slideouts, or to check the interior dash operation, listen to the engine to determine if there are any unusual noises or erratic idling.
&lt;p&gt;Engine Compartment Cleanliness – is the engine compartment caked with oil and dust or does it appear to have been maintained?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiator Condition – are the cooling fins bent or are there signs of damage to the coils or fins?&amp;nbsp; Is there bug debris present?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coolant Reservoir Condition – Is the reservoir at the appropriate level, the cap installed, is there any tank damage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiator Hoses Condition – are the hoses pliable and without cracks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitch Receiver Condition – the condition of the rear hitch: bent, severe rust, scrape damage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7-Pin Connector Condition – is a trailer electrical plug able to plug into the plug receiver attached to the RV’s electrical system.&amp;nbsp; You can use a plug tester here to check operation during the 12-volt chassis lights evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engine Brand – from the manufacturer’s brochure, the engine itself, or the incomplete chassis VIN data plate inside the RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engine Model – from the manufacturer’s brochure, the engine itself, or the incomplete chassis VIN data plate inside the RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engine Type – gas or diesel located in the front or the rear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engine Mileage – obtained from the dash when the engine is running if the dash is digital in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash AC – operate while the engine is running and measure the output temperature with a probe thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash Radio – check operation while the engine is running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil/Filter Change – if known, record that information.&amp;nbsp; The best source or this is the owner.&amp;nbsp; If the RV is at a dealership this will most likely be unknown.&amp;nbsp; You may find record in the owners packet as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuel Filter – if known, record that information.&amp;nbsp; The best source or this is the owner.&amp;nbsp; If the RV is at a dealership this will most likely be unknown.&amp;nbsp; You may find record in the owners packet as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhaust Leaks – while the engine is running examine the exhaust system from the rear of the RV.&amp;nbsp; Exhaust should only be coming out of the tailpipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Leaks – any signs of oil leaks around the engine compartment or underneath at the bottom of the engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Pressure Reading – obtain this while the engine is running.&amp;nbsp; It may be a high, normal or low reading, or it may be more accurate depending on the gauge that the chassis manufacturer installs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Analysis Performed – yes or no.&amp;nbsp; If the inspector is onsite and the client has not purchased fluid analysis, and the inspector notices something that might be better answered by fluid analysis, call the client: oil smells like gas, has debris on the dipstick, for a gas engine, is dark black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Level on Dipstick – read this before starting the engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engine Starts – did it start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiator Location – front, rear, or on the rear side of the RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coolant Analysis Performed – yes or no.&amp;nbsp; If the inspector is onsite and the client has not purchased fluid analysis, and the inspector notices something that might be better answered by fluid analysis, call the client: coolant smells rancid, has debris in the overflow tank, is not the expected color as specified by the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coolant Fans Accessible and Operational – while the engine is running, is the fan operational?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooling Fan Type – Belt-driven fans pull air through the radiator all the time, regardless of cooling requirements. Hydraulic fan drives determine fan speed based on cooling demands, not engine speed. Look for hydraulic hoses to the fan motor.&amp;nbsp; An electric fan completely removes the mechanical load of spinning the fan from the engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most rear radiator equipped coaches employ direct belt driven fan assemblies.&amp;nbsp; These generally do not have a thermostat-controlled clutch, as opposed to the side mount.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The overall average input energy requirements may well be lower than that of the side mount.&amp;nbsp; This is due to the need to power the remote fan assemblies with either a hydraulic power system or a mechanical drive system.&amp;nbsp; The hydraulic units are powered by an engine driven pump assembly.&amp;nbsp; This in turn drives a hydraulic motor that rotates the fan blades.&amp;nbsp; This is controlled through an electronic valve that varies the fan speed, usually two or so set speeds.&amp;nbsp; The Direct drive units must drive the cooling fan through two ninety-degree configurations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Most, if not all of these, employ a thermostat-controlled clutch.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; These are generally far more complex than one would imagine.&amp;nbsp; They are activated by more than just engine coolant temperature such as, intake manifold temperature, transmission temperature, exhaust gas temperature and like.&amp;nbsp; Some are driven through an electro-magnet field that increases field strength as temperatures rise and finally lock up an electric clutch at, or near, the high limits.&amp;nbsp; Some of these side mounted fan drive assemblies can take up to 70 horsepower to drive during peek demand/RPM scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rear radiator equipped pushers tend to attract more dirt than side.&amp;nbsp; This is due to the rear fan pushing the air from the engine compartment out, while side moves the air from out to in.&amp;nbsp; The dirt build up on the rad core is caused be an oil film that can gather on the fins.&amp;nbsp; Usually the majority of this oil comes from misting from the crank case ventilator tube.&amp;nbsp; This tube can be extended using a piece of hose eliminating this issue.&amp;nbsp; Most such equipped coaches are already designed in this manner.&amp;nbsp; The rear radiator does, however, still attract a little more dirt than the side.&amp;nbsp; This is because of the motor being directly up wind which blows any engine sweat through it.&amp;nbsp; Any build up within the radiator fins usually indicates a lack of regular cleaning.&amp;nbsp; These must be washed periodically.&amp;nbsp; This is a simple procedure using a product like Simply Green.&amp;nbsp; Just spray it into the radiator core, let it sit, and rinse it out.&amp;nbsp; Do not use a pressure sprayer as it may damage the cooling fins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transmission Brand – obtained form the manufacturer brochure or from the manufacturer label inside the RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transmission Leaks – look around the transmission area underneath the RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transmission Analysis Performed – yes or no.&amp;nbsp; If the inspector is onsite and the client has not purchased fluid analysis, and the inspector notices something that might be better answered by fluid analysis, call the client: oil smells burnt, has debris on the dipstick, is a brownish or dark red color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transmission Oil Contaminated or Discolored – may be able to identify issues from the oil on the dipstick, but best answered when doing fluid analysis and the inspector can see the fluid color in the sample bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transmission Fluid Level on Dipstick – check before starting the engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitch Receiver Brand – obtained from the hitch.&amp;nbsp; There may be a label on the hitch detailing manufacturer and specs for load carrying ability.&amp;nbsp; Also, comment if you feel there have been visible changes made to the hitch: additional welds or metal supports applied to try and increase load capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitch Weight Rating – from the manufacturer label of from the RV brochure.&lt;/p&gt;

		<iiText>Chassis and Frame Condition</iiText>
		<iiHelp>Chassis and Frame Condition - The chassis is the backbone of every RV.&amp;nbsp; It is the framework that not only supports the body of your RV, but also houses the primary mechanics of your recreation vehicle, including everything from the motor itself, to the transmission and drive train, down to the wheels, axles, suspension, fuel &amp;amp; exhaust systems, and electrical wiring.
&lt;p&gt;The inspect is to evaluate the chassis and frame from all sides of the RV and not crawling any farther than half one’s body length to view the chassis.&amp;nbsp; This is best accomplished using a foam or rubber mat, or creeper if you want, and lie on your back to evaluate the frame and chassis for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Signs of rust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Bent or damaged components&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Visible signs of excessive wear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Visible signs of excess oil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Visible signs of scraping or drag damage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Visible signs of damage from tire failure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hydraulic hose leaks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Condition of the airbags, if installed and visible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Missing or loose bolts securing chassis components&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shock Absorber System Condition – look for signs of leaking shocks, broken shocks, or shock absorber ends that have become disconnected from the RV frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running Gear (axles, springs, rims and other components) – this is what the RV rides on.&amp;nbsp; Evaluate for loose or missing components, missing bolts or nuts, leaking oil bath wheel bearings, cracked wheel rims, or other cracked components that are visible to the inspector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axle Weight Ratings – these can be obtained from the manufacturers VIN data plate, the incomplete VIN data plate, or the cargo capacity label.</iiHelp>
